To execute:

Kindly open the terminal and type 

'chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh'

to execute the program.

run.sh is my custom made shell-script that compiles .java files, creates the
packages which I created and then runs the program.

The driver program is 'Main.java' and other .java files are for the other classes which I created.

**Bonus description**:
    I've coded another functionality of the game where the user can enter the number of 
    floors which she wants the game to have. Then the user can enter the number of Normal Snake,
    King Cobra, Ladder and elevator floors she'd like the game to have and then respectively enter 
    the corresponding floor numbers.

    All Normal Snakes move player's position to floor 1 and reduce 2 points of player's score irrespective of normal snake's floor
    All King Cobras move player's position to floor 3 and reduce 4 points of player's score irrespective of king cobra's floor
    and similarly for Ladder and Elevator floors.

    An execution of this bonus code is commented out in Main.java
