To execute:

Kindly open the terminal and type 

'chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh'

to execute the program.

run.sh is my custom made shell-script that compiles .java files, creates the
packages which I created and then runs the program.

The driver program is 'Main.java' and other .java files are for the other classes
which I created.
